# Huawei Config Utility

A demo of configuring Huawei S1700/S5700 series switches via its NETCONF HTTP API. 

## Compatibility

Should be compatible with S1700/S1720/S1730/S5700/S5720/S5730/S5735.

Actually tested:
- S5720 V200R019

## Notes

### NETCONF

- `message-id` doesn't matter; it doesn't need to be the same as the one in the HTTP request too
